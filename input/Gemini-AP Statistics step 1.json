You'll start by learning how to describe and display data for a single variable. We'll explore different types of variables—categorical and quantitative—and the best ways to represent them using tables, charts, and graphs. You'll master the art of describing distributions by their shape, center, and spread, and learn to identify any unusual features like outliers. We'll dive into key summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles, understanding what they tell us and when to use them. Finally, you'll be introduced to the most famous distribution in statistics: the Normal model. This unit provides the essential vocabulary and analytical skills you'll use throughout the entire course to make sense of the data that surrounds us every day.",

The highlight of this unit is the Central Limit Theorem, a remarkable result that says that for large samples, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately Normal, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. Understanding sampling distributions is the key to understanding how we can use a single sample to make a reliable inference about an entire population.",

You will learn to think of the observed slope of the sample regression line as just one possible slope from a sampling distribution of all possible slopes. This sets the stage for using confidence intervals and significance tests to make conclusions about the true population slope.",

You will learn the four-step process for constructing this interval. A key part of this is understanding the conditions for inference for regression, which include checking for a linear relationship, independent observations, Normal residuals, and equal variance of residuals. We will often use computer output to find the necessary values, so a key skill will be to read and interpret this output to find the sample slope and its standard error.",

As with other parameters, you will practice writing a clear, contextual interpretation of the interval and the confidence level. A key use of this interval is to determine if there is a relationship between the variables. If the interval for the slope contains 0, it is plausible that the true slope is 0, meaning there is no linear relationship. If the interval does not contain 0, we have evidence of a genuine linear association.",

This test is the formal way to confirm that a pattern we see in a scatterplot is statistically significant.",
